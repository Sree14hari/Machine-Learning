Welcome to my **Machine Learning** repository! üöÄ This collection serves as a portfolio of my work, showcasing various end-to-end machine learning projects. Each project is self-contained in its own folder with a dedicated README explaining the problem statement, dataset, methodology, and results.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run any of these projects on your local machine, follow these steps:

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Sree14hari/Machine-Learning.git](https://github.com/Sree14hari/Machine-Learning.git)
cd Machine-Learning
````

**2. Navigate to a project folder:**

```bash
# Example:
cd "Diabetes Prediction"
```

**3. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**

```bash
# Create and activate the environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

**4. Install the required dependencies:**
Each project folder contains a `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**5. Launch Jupyter Notebook and explore\!**

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
